    "Title": "About Me",
    "Description": "As a dedicated eSports athlete at Dortmund eSports e.V. and aspiring fullstack developer, I combine technical skills in JavaScript and other languages with my passion for team-based strategy games. My educational background includes an ongoing specialization in Node.js and React / React Native at the Zero To Mastery Academy, which has built my skills in modern software development from the ground up. In collaboration with my team, we have achieved several successes in the national and international e-Sport scene. I constantly developed my skills there, which improved my role as team captain with aspects such as team building and performance management. With my apprenticeship at Berufsbildungswerk Mosbach-Heidelberg and my drive for continuous improvement, I am aiming for a career as a Full Stack Developer, which combines my expertise and interest in innovative technologies and gives me a sense of progress.",
